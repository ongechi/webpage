      <p>How to get to st Patricks University</p>
      <p>Educational levels in Kenya are on the rise especially post – secondary education.
         Many students after the completion of their fourth form in Kenya, 
         consider joining institutions of high learning in Kenya- either colleges in Kenya or universities in Kenya. 
         This has increased demand for the establishment of more universities in Kenya and colleges in Kenya. 
         From this spirit, private universities in Kenya have been established , and they offer courses in Kenya practically and very innovatively.
          Common private universities in Kenya include Mt. Kenya University in Kenya, Daystar University in Kenya, 
        Strathmore University in Nairobi and many more upcoming private universities.
        St Patrick University in Kenya is a leading fully chartered Private University based in Nairobi.
        St Patrick University in Kenya has a main aim of providing quality education in Kenya in a Conducive atmosphere,
          with all forms of university research and teaching mechanisms being employed to develop social and ethics services in the society. 
          St Patrixk University in Kenya was started in 1961 as an advanced form six college in Kenya and offered only science and arts subjects then. 
        St Patrick in Kenya later developed to an accountancy college in Kenya in 1966 where students enrolled for CPA course in Kenya.
